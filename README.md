# Coding lab

## Overview
This is a free place to experiment with new ideas, knowledge and technologies that I've learned. This is basically a project with no subject, containing some cool features that I try to emulate from other websites or wish that mine's or my clients' should have. Also, when I want to create something from my own thoughts, just to challenge myself and improve my skills, this is where I usually code.
